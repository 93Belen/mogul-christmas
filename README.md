# mogul-christmas

I was feeling bored so I made this basic HTML Project and I felt like keeping going with this fun project!, so for now there's 4 and a half releases, and more coming soon.

# Important 
Ensure that the last youtube video you watched wasn't on mute, otherwise the autoplay on this site will be muted too. 

# Check it out here
The website is hosted [here](https://kendalldoescoding.gq/mogulchristmas)! 

Make sure you check it out.

# Working on

For now, we're working on making it so that, after the song you selected to be played is over. It completely stops till you press another song to start playing. This will be hard to implement but its a cool feature overall. Other then that, we're working on sorting bugs, etc. You can check out the "Issues" panel for more info.
