<p>Its the most wonderful time of the year</p>
  <p>With the kids jingle belling and everyone telling youll be of good cheer</p>
  <p>Its the most wonderful time of the year</p>
  <p>Its the hap- happest season of all</p>
  <p>With those holiday greetings</p>
  <p>And gay happy meetings when friends come to call</p>
  <p>Its the hap- happest season of all</p>
  <p>There be parties for hosting</p>
  <p>Marshmellows for tosting</p>
  <p>And caroling out in the snow</p>
  <p>There be scary ghost stories and tales of the glories of Christmases</p>
  <p>Long long ago</p>
  <p>Its the most wonderful time of the year</p>
  <p>There be much misoltoeng</p>
  <p>And hearts will be glowing</p>
  <p>When loved ones are near</p>
  <p>Its the most wonderful time of the year</p>
  <p>There be parties for hosting</p>
  <p>Marshmellows for tosting</p>
  <p>And caroling out in the snow</p>
  <p>There be scary ghost stories</p>
  <p>And tales of the glories of Christmases long long ago</p>
  <p>Its the most wonderful time of the year</p>
  <p>There be much misoletong</p>
  <p>And hearts will be glowing</p>
  <p>When loved ones are near</p>
  <p>Its the most wonderful time</p>
  <p>Yes the most wonderful time</p>
  <p>Its the most wonderful time of he year</p>
