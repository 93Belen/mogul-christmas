    <p>I don't want a lot for Christmas</p>
    <p>There is just one thing I need</p>
    <p>I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree</p>
    <p>I just want you for my own</p>
    <p>More than you could ever know</p>
    <p>Make my wish come true</p>
    <p>All I want for Christmas is you</p>
    <p>Yeah</p>
    <p>I don't want a lot for Christmas</p>
    <p>There is just one thing I need (and I)</p>
    <p>Don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree</p>
    <p>I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace</p>
    <p>Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day</p>
    <p>I just want you for my own</p>
    <p>More than you could ever know</p>
    <p>Make my wish come true</p>
    <p>All I want for Christmas is you</p>
    <p>You, baby</p>
    <p>Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas</p>
    <p>I won't even wish for snow (and I)</p>
    <p>I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe</p>
    <p>I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick</p>
    <p>I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click</p>
    <p>'Cause I just want you here tonight</p>
    <p>Holding on to me so tight</p>
    <p>What more can I do?</p>
    <p>Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you</p>
    <p>You, baby</p>
    <p>Oh-oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere (so brightly, baby)</p>
    <p>And the sound of children's laughter fills the air (oh, oh, yeah)</p>
    <p>And everyone is singing (oh, yeah)</p>
    <p>I hear those sleigh bells ringing</p>
    <p>Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh)</p>
    <p>Won't you please bring my baby to me?</p>
    <p>Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas</p>
    <p>This is all I'm asking for</p>
    <p>I just wanna see my baby standing right outside my door</p>
    <p>Oh, I just want you for my own</p>
    <p>More than you could ever know</p>
    <p>Make my wish come true</p>
    <p>Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you</p>
    <p>You, baby</p>
    <p>All I want for Christmas is you, baby</p>
    <p>All I want for Christmas is you, baby</p>
    <p>All I want for Christmas is you, baby</p>
    <p>All I want for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby</p>
    <p>All I want (I want) for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby</p>
