 <p>
    Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
    Jack Frost nipping at your nose
    Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
    And folks dressed up like Eskimos
    Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
    Help to make the season bright
    Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
    Will find it hard to sleep tonight
    They know that Santa's on his way
    He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
    And every mother's child is gonna spy
    To see if reindeers really know how to fly
    And so I'm offering this simple phrase
    To kids from one to ninety-two
    Although it's been said many times, many ways
    Merry Christmas to you
    And so I'm offering this simple phrase
    To kids from one to ninety-two
    Although it's been said many times, many ways
    Merry Christmas to you
