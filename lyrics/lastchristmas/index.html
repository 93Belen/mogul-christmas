<div class="lyrics">
  <p>Last Christmas, I gave you my heart</p>
  <p>But the very next day, you gave it away</p>
  <p>This year, to save me from tears</p>
  <p>I'll give it to someone special</p>
  <p>Last Christmas, I gave you my heart</p>
  <p>But the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)</p>
  <p>This year, to save me from tears</p>
  <p>I'll give it to someone special (special)</p>
  <p>Once bitten and twice shy</p>
  <p>I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye</p>
  <p>Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?</p>
  <p>Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me</p>
  <p>"Merry Christmas, " I wrapped it up and sent it</p>
  <p>With a note saying "I love you, " I meant it</p>
  <p>Now I know what a fool I've been</p>
  <p>But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again</p>
  <p>Last Christmas, I gave you my heart</p>
  <p>But the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)</p>
  <p>This year, to save me from tears</p>
  <p>I'll give it to someone special (special)</p>
  <p>Last Christmas, I gave you my heart</p>
  <p>But the very next day, you gave it away</p>
  <p>This year, to save me from tears</p>
  <p>I'll give it to someone special (special)</p>
  <p>Oh</p>
  <p>Oh, oh, baby</p>
  <p>A crowded room, friends with tired eyes</p>
  <p>I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice</p>
  <p>My God, I thought you were someone to rely on</p>
  <p>Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on</p>
  <p>A face on a lover with a fire in his heart</p>
  <p>A man under cover but you tore me apart</p>
  <p>Ooh, ooh, now I've found a real love</p>
  <p>You'll never fool me again</p>
  <p>Last Christmas, I gave you my heart</p>
  <p>But the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)</p>
  <p>This year, to save me from tears</p>
  <p>I'll give it to someone special (special)</p>
  <p>Last Christmas, I gave you my heart</p>
  <p>But the very next day, you gave it away</p>
  <p>This year, to save me from tears</p>
  <p>I'll give it to someone special (special!)</p>
  <p>A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you mine)</p>
  <p>A man under cover, but you tore him apart</p>
  <p>Maybe next year, we'll give it to someone</p>
  <p>I'll give it to someone special (special!)</p>
  <p>So long!</p>
